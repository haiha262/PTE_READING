1. Traditionally, poverty has been measured by the lack of a minimum income or consumption level necessary to meet basic needs. Measuring poverty on a global scale (requires/ needs/ keeps/ improves) establishing a uniform poverty level across extremely divergent economies, which can result in only rough comparisons. The World Bank has defined the international poverty line as U.S. $1 and $2 per day in 1993 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), which adjusts for differences in the (prices/ costs/ charges / fees) of goods and services between countries. The $1 per day level is generally used for the (least/ secondary/ less/ profit) developed countries, primarily African; the $2-per-day level is used for middle (income/ revenue/ profit/ cost) economies such as those of East Asia and Latin America.

2. An exotic type of diamond may have come to Earth from outer space, scientists say. Called carbonado or ÒblackÓ diamonds, the (mysterious/ complex/ complicated/ difficult) stones are found in Brazil and the Central African Republic. They are unusual for being the color or charcoal and full of frothy bubbles. The diamonds, which can weigh in at more than 3,600 carats, can also have a face that looks like melted glass. Because of their (beautiful/ odd/ ugly/ weird) appearance, the diamonds are unsuitable as gemstones. But they do have industrial applications and were used in the drill bits that helped dig the Panama Canal. Now a team led by Stephen Haggerty of Florida International University in Miami has presented a new study (suggesting/ imposing/ declaring /saying) that the odd stones were brought to Earth by an asteroid billions of years ago. The findings were published online in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters on December 20. 
Explosive Theory: The scientists exposed polished pieces of carbonado to extremely intense infrared light. The test revealed the presence of many hydrogen-carbon bonds, indicating that the diamonds probably formed in a hydrogen-rich environmentÑsuch as that found in space. The diamonds also showed strong similarities to tiny nanodiamonds, which are frequently found in meteorites. "They're not (identical/ similar/ alike/ same)," Haggerty said, "but they're very similar. Astrophysicists, he added, have developed theories predicting that nanodiamonds form easily in the titanic stellar explosions called supernovas, which scatter debris through interstellar space. The deposits in the Central African Republic and Brazil, he said, (probably/ obviously/ definitely/completely)Êcome from the impact of a diamond-rich asteroid billions of years ago, when South America and Africa were joined.

3. The fall of smallpox began with the realization that (survivors/ people/ victims/ patients) of the disease were immune for the rest of their lives. This led to the practice of variolation - a process of exposing a healthy person to infected material from a person with smallpox in the hopes of producing a mild disease that (contributed/ provided/ gave/ transferred) immunity from further infection. The first written account of variolation describes a Buddhist nun practicing around 1022 to 1063 AD. By the 1700's, this method of variolation was (same/ common/ usual/ frequent) practice in China, India, and Turkey. In the late 1700's European physicians used this and other methods of variolation, but reported "devastating" results in some cases. Overall, 2% to 3% of people who were variolated died of smallpox, but this practice decreased the total number of smallpox (fatalities/ patients/ diseases/ victims) by 10-fold. 

4. The environmental impact of the global textile industry is hard to overstate. One-third of the water used worldwide is spent fashioning fabrics. For every ton of cloth                  (produced/ made/ generated/ provided), 200 tons of water is polluted with chemicals and heavy metals. An estimated 1 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity powers the factories that card and comb, spin and weave, and cut and stitch materials into everything from T-shirts to towels, (abandoning/ leaving/ dumping/ throwing) behind mountains of solid waste and a massive carbon footprint.
ÒWhere the industry is today is not really sustainable for the long term,Ó says Shreyaskar Chaudhary, chief executive of Pratibha Syntex, a textile manufacturer based in India. With something of an Òif you build it, they will comeÓ attitude, Mr Chaudhary has steered Pratibha (for/ to/ at/ toward) the leading edge of eco-friendly textile production.
Under his direction, Pratibha began making clothes with organic cotton in 1999. Initially, the company couldn't find enough organic farms growing cotton in central India to (supply/ indulge/ help/ develop) its factories. To meet production demands, Chaudhary's team had to convince conventional cotton farmers to change their growing methods. Pratibha provided seeds, cultivation instruction, and a guarantee of fair-trade prices for (farmersÕ/ their/ its/ peasantsÕ) crops.

5. It is the assertion of this article that students who use visual art as a pre-writing stimulus are composing their ideas both in images and in words. The result of the art creation process allows students the distance to (understand/ elaborate/ extravagant/ build up), add details, and create more coherent text. The process of writing is more than putting words on a piece of paper. Effective authors are able to create imagery and to communicate ideas using well-chosen words, phrases, and text structures. Emergent writers struggle with the (structures/ mechanics/ procedures/ ways)   of the writing process, i.e., fine motor control for printing legibly, recall of spelling patterns, and the use of syntax and grammar rules. As a result, texts written by young writers tend to be simplistic and formulaic. The artwork facilitates the writing process, resulting in a text that is richer in sensory detail and more intricate than the more traditional writing-first crayon drawing-second (way/ approach/ technique/ method). 

6. Never has the carbon footprint of multi-national corporations been under such intense scrutiny. Inter-city train journeys and long-haul flights to (conduct/ have/ attend/ lead/ hold) face-to-face business meetings contribute significantly to greenhouse gases and the resulting (effects/ strain/ stress/ impact/consequences) on the environment. The Anglo-US company Teliris has introduced a new video-conferencing technology and partnered with the Carbon Neutral Company, enabling corporate outfits to become more environmentally responsible. The innovation allows simulated face-to-face meetings to be held across continents without the time (concern/ difficulty/ pressure/ burden) or environmental burden of international travel. The technology can bring up to five separate locations anywhere in the world Ð with (perfect/ unrivalled/ exceptional/ unparalleled) transmission quality.

7. Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh has become the first in Europe to offer an MBA in Arabic. Arab students will be able to sign up to study at (student/ area/ era/ distance)Êfor the business courses in their own language. The Edinburgh Business School (declared/ announced/ revealed/ disclosed) the project at a reception in Cairo on Saturday. It is hoped the course will improve links between the university and the Arab business world. A university spokeswoman said that it was hoped that the Arabic MBA would (raise/ rise/ extend/ enlarge) the profile of Heriot-Watt University and the Edinburgh Business School among businesses in the Arabic-speaking world. It is also hoped that a strong network of graduates will be created in the (region/ area/ location/ zone). The first (intake/ admission/ taking in /course) of students is expected later this year.

8. ItÕs probably one of the most overused phrases in job-hunting, but also one of the most underutilized by job-seekers: dress for success, in job-hunting, first (feeling/ impression/ impact /contact) are critical. Remember, you are marketing a product Ñ yourself Ñ to a potential employer, and the first thing the employer sees when greeting you is your attire; thus, you must make every effort to have the proper dress for the type of job you are seeking. Will dressing properly get you the job? Of course not, but it will give you a competitive edge and a (absolute/ negative/ positive / certain)Êfirst impression. Should you be judged by what you wear? Perhaps not, but the reality is, of course, that you are judged. Throughout the entire job-seeking process employers use short-cuts Ñ heuristics or rules of thumb Ñ to save time. With cover letters, itÕs the opening paragraph and a quick scan of your qualifications. With resumes, it is a quick scan of your accomplishments. With the job interview, itÕs how youÕre dressed that sets the (intonation/ accent/ tone/ rhythm) of the interview. How should you dress? Dressing conservatively is always the safest route, but you should also try and do a little investigating of your (prospective/ coming/ approaching/ expected) employer so that what you wear to the interview makes you look as though you fit in with the organization. If you overdress (which is rare but can happen) or underdress (the more likely scenario), the potential employer may feel that you donÕt care enough about the job.Ê

9. Thomas Alva Edison was both a scientist and an inventor. Born in 1847, Edison would see (amazing/ tremendous/ enormous /inevitable) change take place in his lifetime. He was also to be responsible for making many of those changes occur. When Edison was born, society still thought of electricity as   (novelty/ oddity/ new/ change), a fad. By the time he died, entire cities were lit by electricity. Much of the credit for that progress goes to Edison. In his lifetime, Edison patented 1,093 inventions. The most famous of his inventions was an incandescent light bulb. Besides the light bulb, Edison developed the phonograph and the "kinetoscope," a small box for viewing moving films. He also (corrected/ improved/ amended/ fixed) upon the original design of the stock ticker, the telegraph, and Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. In (appreciation/ addition/ tribute /memory) to this important American, electric lights in the United States were dimmed for one minute on October 21, 1931, a few days after his death. 

10. Agrarian parties are political parties chiefly representing the interests of peasants or, more broadly, the rural sector of society. The extent to which they are important, or (whether/ when/ as if/ if) they even exist, depends mainly on two factors. One, obviously, is the size of an identifiable peasantry, or the size of the rural relative (to/ in/ of/ from) the urban population. The other is a matter of social integration: (to/ for/ as/ of) agrarian parties to be important, the representation of countryside or peasantry must be not integrated with the other sections of society. (So/ However/ Thus/ Although) a country might possess a sizeable rural population, but have an economic system in which the interests of the voters depended predominantly on their incomes (higher/ rather/ better/ bigger/ other) than their occupations or location; and in such a country the political system would be unlikely to include an important agrarian party. 

11. Comparing the intelligence of animals of different species is difficult, how do you compare a dolphin and a horse? Psychologists have a technique for looking at intelligence that (can/must/does/shall) not require the cooperation of the animal involved. The relative size of an individualÕs brain is a reasonable indication of intelligence. Comparing (over/across/with/in) species is not as simple an elephant will have a larger brain than a human simple because it is a large beast. (Instead/Moreover/However/Actually) we use the Cephalization index, which compare the size of an animalÕs brain to the size of its body. Based on the Cephalization index, the brightest animals on the planet are humans, (followed/follows/follow/following) by great apes, porpoises and elephants. As a general (theory/way/rule/model) animals that hunt for a living (like canines) are smarter than strict vegetarians (you don't need much intelligence to outsmart a leaf of lettuce). Animals that live in social groups are always smarter and have large EQ's than solitary animals.

12. "DNA barcoding was invented by Paul Hebert of the University of Guelph, in Ontario, Canada, in 2003. His idea was to (generate/ cause/ breed/ fashion) a unique identification tag for each species based on a short stretch of DNA. Separating species would then be a simple task of sequencing this tiny bit of DNA. Dr Hebert proposed part of a gene called cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) as suitable to the task. All animals have it. It seems to vary enough, but not too much, to act as a reliable marker. And it is easily (extracted/ sliced/ delivered/provided), because it is one of a handful of genes found outside the cell nucleus, in structures called mitochondria.
The idea worked, and it has dramatically reduced the time (to less than an hour) and expense (to less than $2) of using DNA to identify species. And thus, in July this year, Dr Victor's mystery goby became Coryphopterus Kuna. It was the first vertebrate to have its DNA barcodeÑa sequence of about 600 genetic ÒlettersÓÑincluded in its official description.
Barcoding has taken off rapidly since Dr Hebert invented it. When the idea was proposed, it was expected to be a (boon/ hand/extra/premium) to taxonomists trying to name the world's millions of species. It has, however, proved to have a far wider range of uses than the merely academicÑmost promisingly in the (mainstream/ realm/ range/ extent) of public health.
One health-related project is the Mosquito Barcoding Initiative being run by Yvonne-Marie Linton of the Natural History Museum in London. This aims to barcode 80% of the world's mosquitoes within the next two years, to help control mosquito-borne diseases. Mosquitoes are (responsible/ bound/ uncountable/ innocent) for half a billion malarial infections and 1m deaths every year. They also (spread /transfer / transmit/ pass on) devastating diseases such as yellow fever, West Nile fever and dengue. However, efforts to control them are consistently (undermined/ weaken/ increased/ lower) by the difficulty and expense of identifying mosquitoesÑof which there are at least 3,500 species, many of them hard to tell apart.

13. There were twenty-six freshmen (majoring/ studying/ enrolling/ joining) in English at Beijing Language Institute in the class of 1983, I was assigned to Group Two with another eleven boys and girls who had (come/ arrived/ originally / born) from big cities in China. I was only the student who had been raised in a small village. On the first day of class, I arrived eager (to begin/beginning/begin/began) I settled myself at a desk and only then did I (realise/to realise/ realising/ realized) I was told that language study required smallness so that we would get more attention from the skilful teachers. The better the school, the smaller the class. I realized that my classmates were already all (talking/ speaking/ telling/ communicating) in English, simple sentences tossed out to each other in their red-faced introductions and carefree chatting. Their intonations were curving and dramatic and their pronunciation refined and accurate. But as I stretched to catch the drips and drops of their humming dialogue, I couldn't (understand/ understood/ to understand/ understanding) it all, only that it was English. Those words now flying before me sounded a little familiar. I had read them and tried to speak them, but I had never heard them (spoken/to speak/speak/speaking) back to me in such a speedy, fluent manner. My big plan of (beating/ smashing/trashing/destroying) the city folks was thawing before my eyes.

14. One thing is certain. Most people do not get enough exercise in their          (daily/frequent/recurrent/periodic) routines. All of the advances of modern technology Ð from (electric/ electrician/ electrically/ electricity) can openers to power steering - have made life easier, more comfortable and much less physically (severe/ demanding/ relaxing/ insistent). Yet our bodies need activity, especially if they are carrying around too (many/ little/ less/ much) fat. Satisfying this need requires a definite plan, and a commitment. There are two (odd/ main/ large/ substantial) ways to increase the number of calories you expand:
Start a regular exercise program if you do not have one already.
Increase the amount of physical activity in your daily routine.

15. Scientists preparing for NASAÕs proposed Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter believe that JupiterÕs moons Europa may be a corrosive mixture of acid and peroxide. Thus, it may not be the (ideal/ suitable/ relevant/ correct/ lucky) place for life to exist as was thought possibly to be the case. (Virtually/ Completely/ Eventually/ Entirely/ Scarcely)  all the information we have about Europa comes from the spacecraft Galileo, which completed its mission to study Jupiter and its moons close up before NASA dramatically crashed it into Jupiter in 2003. (Because/ Although/ Despite/ Whatever/ Whether) the general perception of Europa is of a frozen crust of water ice harbouring a salty subterranean ocean kilometres below, researchers studying the most             (recent/ unusual/ last/ interesting) measurements say light reflected from the moonÕs icy surface bears the spectral fingerprints of hydrogen peroxide and strong acids. (Instead/ Just/ Regardless/ However/ Therefore) they accept that it could just be a thin surface dusting and might not come from the ocean below.

16. The presentation will cover copyrightÕs position as one of the intellectual property rights and now it (differs/ similar/ similarity/ different/ encompasses) from other intellectual rights it will give (a conclusion/ a summation/ the answer/ an overview / an objective) of what copyright protects as well as what may be done with copyright protected works without permission under permitted acts (sometimes or so-called exception). It is by manipulating the restricted acts through licensing arrangements that rights owner (determine/ establish/ confirm/ prove/ verify) and exploit commercial markets in contrast to commercial markets, the growth of open source and open content licensing models has (challenged/ opposed/ supported/ objected) established business models. The presentation gives a brief commentary on two of the more (insignificant/ prominent/ trivial/ main/ major) open licensing frameworks the GNU Creative Common licenses. 

17. Three degrees does not sound like much but it (undermines/ predicts/ represents/ proves/ explores) a rise in temperature compatible with the global heating that occurred between the last ice age, some 15,000 years ago, and the warmth of the eighteenth century. When Earth was cold, giant glaciers sometimes extended from the polar regions as far south as St Louis in the US and the Alps in Europe. Later this century when it is three degree hotter glaciers everywhere will be melting in a climate of often (particular/ unbearable/ historic/ temperate/ comfortable) heat and drought, punctuated with storms and floods. The (achievements/ consequences/ phenomena/ dreams/ considerations) for humanity could be truly horrific; if we fail to act swiftly, the full impact of global heating could cull us along with vast populations of the plant and animals with whom we share Earth. In a worst case scenario, there might Ð in the 22nd century Ð be only a remnant of humanity eking out a (old-fashioned/ economical/ successful/ diminished/ peculiar) existence in the polar regions and the few remaining oases left on a hot and arid Earth.  

18. Remember  when  universities  were  bursting  at  the  seams  with  students  sitting  in the  aisles,  balancing  books  on  their  knees?  No more, it seems.  E-learning is as likely to stand for empty lecture theatres as for the internet (generation/ revolution/ information /data), which has greatly increased the volume and range of course, materials available online in the past five years.  "The (temptation/ lure/ attraction/ understanding) now  is  to  simply  think,  'Everything  will  be online so I don't need to go to class'," said Dr Kerri-Lee Krause, of the Centre for the  Study  of  Higher  Education  at  the  University  of  Melbourne.  The  nation's universities  are  in  the  process  of  opening  the  doors  for  the  new  academic  year and,  while  classes  are  generally  well (attended/ absent/ provided/ emptied) for the  early  weeks,  it often  does not  last.  "There  is  concern  at  the  university  level  about  student  attendance dropping  and  why  students  are  not  coming  to  lectures,"  Dr  Krause said.  But lecturersÕ pride - and (fierce/ rough/ large/ major) competition among universities for students - mean few are willing to acknowledge publicly how poorly attended many classes are.

19. Richard Morris, of the school of accounting at the University of NSW, which requires an entrance score in the top 5 per cent of students, says attendance has been a problem since the late 1990s. "Sometimes in the lectures we've only got about one third of students enrolled attending," he said. "It definitely is a problem. If you don't turn up to class you're missing out on the whole richness of the (experience/ lecture/ knowledge/ training): you don't think a whole lot, you don't engage in debates with other students - or with your teachers." It is not all gloom, said Professor John Dearn, a Pro Vice Chancellor at the University of Canberra, who said the internet was                       (transforming/ altering/ changing/ improving) the way students access and use information. "It is strange that despite all the evidence as to their ineffectiveness,   (interesting /traditional/ old-fashioned/ dull) lectures seem to persist in our universities."

20. "When people ask how many countries there are in the world, they expect a simple answer.    (After all/ Although/ Above all/ Finally[Office1]), we've (explored/ travelled/ researched/ analysed)  the whole planet, we have international travel, satellite navigation and plenty of global organizations like the United Nations, so we should really know how many countries there are!
However, the answer to the question varies (according to/ related to/ depending on /owing to) whom you ask. Most people say there are 192 countries, but others point out that there could be more like 260 of them. So why isn't there a straight forward answer?
The problem (lifts/ arises[Office2]/ uprises/ rises) because there isn't a universally agreed definition of 'country' and because, for political reasons, some countries (think /find / consider/ figure out) it convenient to recognize or not recognize other countries.

21. WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 Ñ By 2025, government experts say, Americas skies will swarm with three (times/ meters/ turns/ much) as many planes, and not just the kind of traffic flying today. There will be (thousands/ many/   enormous/ bunch[Office3]) of tiny jets, seating six or fewer, at airliner altitudes, competing for space with remotely operated drones that need help avoiding mid-air (bumps/ collisions/ hits/ crash), and with commercially operated rockets carrying (satellites/ planets/ space crafts/ rockets) and tourists into space. To keep passengers moving safely and on schedule, the Federal Aviation Administration needs to replace a half-century of outmoded technology with a new air traffic control system. But almost everything about the proposed new system is unsettled, not only its digital nuts and bolts, but also the leadership, the financing and the staffing of a modern aviation network.

22. After an absence of more than 50 years, the grey wolf (Canis lupus) once again runs beneath the night skies of Yellowstone National Park. At 3:45 pm on March 21st 1995, the first of three groups of grey wolves (also known as the timber wolf) were released from (fenced/restricted[Office4]/contained/confounded) acclimation pens at Crystal Creek within Yellowstone National Park. The wolf release plan, (involved/ calculated/ evaluated/ concealed) in an environmental impact statement (EIS) in 1992-1994, is to restore wolves to Yellowstone and central Idaho by establishing experimental populations of grey wolves in both areas. The goal for Yellowstone is to establish 10 packs wolves reproducing in the area for three (following[Office5]/ chronological/ consecutive/ alternate) years by the year 2002. Restoring wolves to Yellowstone is in keeping with national park goals to perpetuate all native species and their natural interactions with their environment. As with other park wildlife programs, management emphasizes [Office6](exaggerating/ introducing/ appreciating/ minimizing) human impact on natural animal population dynamics. Yellowstone National Park is a wilderness and wildlife refuge in the United States.

23. The amount of sleep you need depends on many (factors/hours/elements/ processes), especially your age. New-borns sleep between 16 and 18 hours a day and preschool children should sleep between 10 and 12 hours. Older children and teens need at least nine hours to be well rested. For most adults, seven to eight hours a night appears to the best amount of sleep. However, for some people, Òenough sleepÓ may be as few as five hours or as many as 10 hours of sleep.
As you get older, your sleeping (patterns/habits/time/routines) change. Older adults tend to sleep more lightly and awaken more frequently in the night than younger adults. This can have many causes including medical conditions and medications used to treat them. But there's no evidence that older adults need less sleep than younger adults.

Getting enough sleep is important to your health because it boosts your (immune/essential/cardiovascular/skeletal) system, which makes your body better able to fight disease. Sleep is necessary for your nervous system to work properly. Too little sleep makes you drowsy and unable to concentrate. It also impairs memory and physical performance.
So how many hours of sleep are enough for you? Experts say that if you feel drowsy during the day Ñ even during boring activities Ñ you are not getting enough sleep. Also, quality of sleep is just as (important/much/less/trivial) as quantity. People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short are not getting quality sleep.
If you experience frequent daytime sleepiness, even after increasing the amount of quality sleep you get, talk to your doctor. He or she may be able to (identify/realize/recognize/understand) the cause of sleep problems and offer advice on how to get a better night's sleep.

24. Books and articles highlighting intractable debt, poverty and development abound in both the academic and popular literature. This addition to the debate is both timely and interesting (so/that/as/in) it subsumes the economic debate to the broader social, political, environmental and institutional context of debt in developing countries. Debt-for-Development Exchanges: History and New Applications is (intended/intend/intending/intentional) for a wide audience including: academics from a range of disciplines (including accounting and finance); non-Government organisations (NGOs); civil society groups; and, both debtor and creditor governments and public sector organization. Professor Ross Buckley, author and editor, (has developed/develops/will develop/have developed) an international profile in the area of debt relief and this book is the outcome of an Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery grant to explore debt-for-development mechanisms that relieve debt, improve development outcomes (from/in/of/by) aid, are practically and politically attractive to creditors and (contribute/contributed/contributing/to contribute) to regional security.

25. Impressionism was a 19th century art movement that began as a loose association of Paris-based artists, who began exhibiting their art publicly in the 1860s. The name of the movement is (derived/ contributed/ taken/ built) from the title of a Claude Mons work impression, Sunrise, which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satiric review. Characteristic of impressionist painting are visible brushstrokes, light colors, open composition, (importance/ emphasis/ choices/ influence) on light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, and unusual visual angles. Radicals in their time, early Impressionists broke the rules of academic painting. They began by giving colours, freely brushed, primacy over line, drawing (aspiration/ inspiration/ masterpieces/ lines) from the work of painters such as Eugene Delacroix. They also took the (artists/ techniques/ act/ toll) of painting out of the studio and into the world. Previously, still lifes and portraits as well as landscapes had usually been painted indoors. The Impressionists found that they could (photograph/ draw/ paint/ capture) the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoor. 

26. Essays are used as assessment tool. They allow the reader to (value/ evaluate/ remember/ calculate/ interpret) your understanding of the subject matters as well as your ability to research a topic and construct an (appreciation/ argument/ assertion/ understanding/ exposition). The lecture does not want to read a regurgitation of everything he or she has said (along/ within/ inside/ throughout/ about) the course. It is advisable to see the essay as an opportunity to explore in greater (intensity/ breadth/ profundity/ depth/ length) aspects of the course Ð theories, issues or texts, for example Ð and in some cases to relate these aspects to a particular context. It is your opportunity to articulate your ideas but you must do so in an appropriate way, using a formal academic style. 

27. People modify cultural ideas in their minds, and sometimes they pass on the modified versions. Inevitably, there are unintentional modifications as well, partly because of straightforward error, and partly because inexplicit ideas are hard to (convey/ contact/ control/ conclude)Êaccurately: there is no way to download them directly from one brain to another like computer programs. Even native speakers of a language will not give identical definitions of every word. So it can be only rarely, if (ever/ often/ true/ only), that two people hold precisely the same cultural idea in their minds. That is why, when the founder of a political or philosophical movement or a religion dies, or even before schisms typically happen. The movementÕs most devoted followers are often shocked to (discover/reveal/know/understand)Êthat they disagree about what its doctrines ÒreallyÓ are.

28. The invasion of non-indigenous plants is considered a primary threat to integrity and function of ecosystems. However, there is little quantitative or (exceptional/ experimental/ aberrational/ aboriginal)Êevidence for ecosystem impacts of invasive species. Justifications for control are often based on potential, but not presently realized, recognized or quantified, negative impacts. Should lack of scientific certainty about impacts of non-indigenous species result in postponing measures to prevent degradation? Recently, management of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), has been criticized for (1) lack of evidence demonstrating negative impacts of L. salicaria, and (2) management using biocontrol for lack of evidence documenting the failure of conventional control methods. Although little quantitative evidence on negative impacts on native wetland biota and wetland function was available at the onset of the control program in 1985, recent work has demonstrated that the invasion of purple loosestrife into North American freshwater wetlands alters (decomposition/ decommissions /decompression/ decompensation)Êrates and nutrient cycling, leads to reductions in wetland plant diversity, reduces pollination and seed output of the native Lythrum alatum, and reduces habitat (suitability/ compatibility/ unsuitability/ correctness)Êfor specialized wetland bird species such as black terns, least bitterns, pied-billed grebes, and marsh wrens. Conventional methods (physical, mechanical or chemical), have continuously failed to (curb/ instruct/ crop/ encourages) the spread of purple loosestrife or to provide satisfactory control. Although a number of generalist insect and bird species utilize purple loosestrife, wetland habitat specialists are excluded by (encroachment/ evolution/ violation/ retreat)Êof L. salicaria. We conclude that (1) negative ecosystem impacts of purple loosestrife in North America justify control of the species and that (2) (detrimental/ despotical/ deprival/ denormal) effects of purple loosestrife on wetland systems and biota and the potential benefits of control outweigh potential risks associated with the introduction of biocontrol agents.

29. Students are increasingly finding it necessary to obtain employment in order to subsidize their income during their time in higher education. The (plus/ other/ more/ super/ extra) income helps to pay for necessities, to maintain a social life and to buy clothes, and holding a part-time job helps students to (gain/ need/ reach/ make/ train)Êskills for life after university or college. Using a part-time job to cut down on borrowing is a sound investment, as it reduces the (debt/ bank/ surplus/ account/ money)Êthat will be waiting to be paid off after graduation. How many hours students are currently working each week during term-time is not really certain. Some institutions advise that students should not work more than ten hours a week, and there are others that set a higher recommend (boundary/ edge/ law/ limit/ border) of fifteen hours a week. There is no doubt that some students (exceed/ improve/ overdo/ raise/ increase) even fifteen hours a week.

30. Over the last ten thousand years there seem to have been two separate and conflicting building sentiments throughout the history of towns and cities. (One/It/What/This) is the desire to start again, for a variety of reasons: an earthquake or a tidal wave may have demolished the settlement, or fire destroyed it, or the new city (does/marks/is/causes) a new political beginning. The other can be likened to the effect of a magnet: established settlements attract people, who (tend to/are used to/ought to/had to) come whether or not there is any planning for their arrival. The clash between these two sentiments is evident in every established city (unless/whenever/whereas/until) its development has been almost completely accidental or is lost in history. Incidentally, many settlements have been planned from the beginning but, for a variety of reasons, no settlement followed the plan. A good example is Currowan, on the Clyde River in New South Wales, which (was surveyed/has been surveyed[Office7]/could be surveyed/had surveyed) in the second half of the 19th century, in expectation that people would come to establish agriculture and a small port. But no one came. Most country towns in New South Wales started with an original survey, whose grid lines are still there today in the pattern of the original streets.

31. Sales jobs allow for a great deal of discretionary time and effort on the part of the sales representatives Ð especially when compared with managerial, manufacturing, and service jobs. Most sales representatives work independently and outside the immediate presence of their sales managers. Therefore, some form of goals needs to be in place (as motive and guide/should motivate and guide/to help motivate and guide/as helping motive and guide) their performance.
Sales personnel are not the only professionals with performance goals or quotas. Health care professionals operating in clinics have daily, weekly, and monthly goals in terms of patient visits. Service personnel are assigned a number of service calls they (can perform/must perform/often are performed/might be performing) during a set time period. Production workers in manufacturing have output goals. So, why are achieving sales goals or quotas such a big deal?
The answer to this question can be found by examining how a firmÕs other departments are affected by how well the companyÕs salespeople achieve their performance goals. The success of the business (hinges on/is set at/lasts until/look ahead) the successful sales of its products and services. Consider all the planning, the financial, production and marketing efforts that go into (describing how/producing what/constructing how much/analyzing where) the sales force sells. Everyone depends on the sales force to sell the companyÕs products and services and they eagerly anticipate knowing things are going. 

32.ÊLook at the recent ÒMost Respected CompaniesÓ survey by the Financial Times. Who are the most respected companies and business leaders at the (current/same/right/exact) time? Rather predictably, they are Jack Weich and General Electric, and Bill Gates, and Microsoft (both/neither/all/two)Êhave achieved their world class status through playing nice. Wetch is still remembered for the brutal downsizing he led his business (out[Office8]/from/through/to) and for the environmental pollution incidents and prosecutions. Microsoft has had one of the (highest/most/finest/best) profile cases of bullying market [Office9]dominance of recent times Ð and Gates has been able to (improve/receive/increase/achieve) the financial status where he can choose to give lots of money away by being ruthless in business.Ê

33. Everybody needs fresh water. (Beside/Outside/Without/Under) water people, animals & plants cannot live. Although a few plants and animals can make do with saltwater, all humans need a constant supply of fresh water to stay (fit/good/well/happy)Ê& healthy. Of the total supply of water on the Earth, only about 3% of it is fresh, & most of that is stored as ice & snow at the poles, or is so (deep/much/long/dirty) under the surface of the Earth that we cannot get to it. Despite so much of the water being out of reach, we still have a million cubic miles of it that we (might/may/will/ can) use. That's about 4,300,000 cubic kilometers of fresh water to share out between most of the plants, animals & people on the planet!

34. Drive down any highway, and youÕll see a proliferation of chain restaurants Ð most likely, if you travel long and far enough, youÕll see McDonaldÕs golden arches as well as signs for Burger King, HardeeÕs, and WendyÕs, the Òbig fourÓ of burgers. Despite its name, though, Burger King has fallen short of (claiming/ forcing/ defying/ yielding) the burger crown, unable to surpass market leader McDonaldÕs No.1 sales status. Always the bridesmaid and never the bride, Burger King remains No.2. Worse yet, Burger King has experienced a six-year 22 percent decline in customer traffic, with its overall quality rating dropping while ratings for the other three (applicants/ contenders/ contestants/ participants) have increase. The decline has been attributed to inconsistent product quality and poor customer service. Although the chain tends to throw advertising dollars at the problem, an understanding of Integrated Marketing Communication theory would suggest that internal management problems (nineteen CEOs in fifty years) need to be (disorganized/ surpassed/ rectified/ enacted) before a unified, long-term strategy can put in place. 
The (importance/vitality/impotence/complacency) of consistency in brand image and messages, at all levels of communication, has become a basic tenet of IMC theory and practice. The person who takes the customerÕs order must communicate the same message as Burger KingÕs famous tagline, ÒHave it your way,Ó or the customer will just buzz up the highway to a chain restaurant that seems more consistent and, therefore, more (reliable/ dubious/ exhaustive/ impervious).

35. Jean Piaget, the pioneering Swiss philosopher and psychologist, spent much of his professional life listening to children, watching children and (examining/ poring/ reading/ contemplating) over reports of researchers around the world who were doing the same. He found, to put it most (accurately/ succinctly/ broadly/ quickly), that children donÕt think like grownups. After thousands of interactions with young people often barely old enough to talk, Piaget began to suspect that behind their cute and seemingly illogical (utterances/ speaking/ intonation/ pronunciation) were thought processes that had their own kind of order and their own special logic. Einstein called it a discovery Òso simple that only a genius could have thought of itÓ
PiagetÕs insight opened a new window into the inner workings of the mind. By the end of a wide ranging and remarkably prolific research career that  (spanned/ expanded/ went/ took) nearly 75 years, from his first scientific publication at age 10 to work still in progress when he died at 84, Piaget had developed several new fields of science: developmental psychology, cognitive theory and that came to be called genetic epistemology. Although not an educational reformer, he championed a way of thinking about children that provided the (basics/ theory/ definition/ foundation) for todayÕs education-reform movements. It was a shift comparable to the displacement of stories of Ònoble savagesÓ and ÒcannibalsÓ by modern anthropology. One might say that Piaget was the first to take childrenÕs thinking (carefully/ seriously/ personally/ intelligently). 

36. Gas drilling on the Indonesian island of Java has triggered a "mud volcano" that has killed 13 people and may (lead/ get/ render/ result) four square miles (ten square kilometers) of countryside uninhabitable for years.  In a report released on January 23, a team of British researchers says the deadly upwelling began when an exploratory gas well punched through a (line/ layer/ floor/ drawer) of rock 9,300 feet (2,800 meters) below the surface, allowing hot, high-pressure water to escape. The water carried mud to the surface, where it has (flowed/ stagnated/run/ spread) across a region 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) in diameter in the eight months since the eruption began. The mud volcano is similar to a gusher or blowout, which occur in oil drilling when oil or gas squirt to the surface, the team says. This upwelling, however, spews out a volume of mud equivalent to a dozen Olympic swimming pools each day. Although the eruption isn't as (violent/ fierce/ harsh/ strong) as a conventional volcano, more than a dozen people died when a natural gas pipeline ruptured. The research team, who published their findings in the February issue of GSA Today, also estimate that the volcano, called Lusi, will leave more than 11,000 people permanently displaced. 

37. Leonard Lauder, chief executive of the company his mother founded, says she always thought she "was growing a nice little business." And that it is. A little business that (controls/ shares/ contributes/ makes) 45% of the cosmetics market in U.S. department stores. A little business that sells in 118 countries and last year grew to be $3.6 billion big in sales. The Lauder family's shares are worth more than $6 billion. But early on, there wasn't a (increasing/ developed/ burgeoning/ rich) business, there weren't houses in New York, Palm Beach, Fla., or the south of France. It is said that at one point there was one person to answer the telephones who changed her voice to become the shipping or billing department as needed. You more or less know the Estee Lauder story because it's a chapter from the book of American business folklore. In short, Josephine Esther Mentzer, daughter of immigrants, lived above her father's hardware store in Corona, a section of Queens in New York City. She started her (factory/ department/ warehouse/ enterprise) by selling skin creams concocted by her uncle, a chemist, in beauty shops, beach clubs and resorts. No doubt the potions were good--Estee Lauder was a quality fanatic--but the saleslady was better. Much better. And she simply (outsourced/ outworked/ outspoken/ output) everyone else in the cosmetics industry. She stalked the bosses of New York City department stores until she got some counter space at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1948. And once in that space, she utilized a personal selling approach that proved as (potent/ essential/ intuitive/ certain) as the promise of her skin regimens and perfumes.

38. Film is where art meets commerce. (So/As/For/What) Orson Welles said: ÒA painter just needs a brush and the writer just needs a pen, but the producer needs an army.Ó And an army needs money. A producer is just like an entrepreneur, we (raise /arise/ rise/ arouse) money to make films. First we need to find an original idea or a book or a play and purchase the rights, then we need money to develop that idea often a reasonably small sum. (Besides/However/Certainly/Therefore), to commission a writer for the screenplay isnÕt something you would want to gamble your own money on, so you find a partner. We are luck here in the UK, as we have Film4, BBC Films and the UK Film Council, all of those are good places to develop an idea. Producing in Britain is very different to producing in America or (even/ still/ despite/ also) Europe because the economic dynamic is different.

39. In recent years, an eccentric mix of English, German and French has entered Japanese usage. (All the same/ Likewise/ For instance/ Furthermore), a ÒKariyaÓ woman is a career woman, and a ÒmanshonÓ is an apartment. This increasing use of katakana, or unique Japanese version of Western words, and the younger generationÕs more casual use of the Japanese language are causing worry in government circles. (As a result/ On the contrary/ Unless[Office10]/ In other words), an official panel is proposing to publish a manual on how to speak proper Japanese. Foreign words become katakana Japanese (although/ whereas/ because/ so that) no existing Japanese words could quite capture a specific meaning or feeling. (Next/ Consequently/ However/ In fact), they donÕt always retain the same meaning they had in their original language. When the word ÒcoolÓ traveled east, all of its English connotations did not make the journey. A kuru person in Japan is someone who is calm and never gets upset. (Besides/ Nevertheless/ For example/ Similarly), a hotto person is one who is easily excitable, but not necessarily a popular person or personality of the moment. Researching and monitoring changes in the Japanese language, including the influx of foreign words, has been the responsibility of the National Institute of Japanese Language, established in 1948. According to its president, Seiju Sugito, since the late 1950s the use of Katakana words has tripled. Older people are especially alarmed by this trend. For one thing, they find many of these new words are difficult to understand. (In addition/ As a consequence/ On the other hand/ In conclusion), their casual and ready acceptance by the younger generation has come in tandem with its increasing tendency not to use the more respectful Japanese grammatical forms.

40. The first section of the book covers new modes of assessment. In Chapter 1, Kimbell (Goldsmith College, London) responds to (critical/ criticizing/ critic/ criticisms) of design programs as formalistic and conventional, stating that a focus on risk-taking rather than hard work in design innovation is equally problematic. His research contains three parts that include preliminary exploration of design innovation qualities, investigation of resulting classroom practices, and development of evidence-based assessment. The assessment he describes is presented in the form of a structured worksheet, which includes a collaborative (element/ substance/ situation/ environ) and digital photographs, in story format. Such a device encourages stimulating ideas, but does not recognize students as design (innovators/ innovations/ innovate/ innovated). The assessment sheet includes holistic impressions as well as details about Òhaving, growing, and provingÓ ideas. (Formal/ Conventional/ Colloquial/ Unofficial)  judgments are evident in terms such as ÒwowÓ and ÒyawnÓ and reward the quality and quantity of ideas with the term, ÒsparkinessÓ, which fittingly is a pun as the model project was to design light bulb packaging. In addition, the assessment focuses on the process of optimizing or complexity control as well as proving ideas with thoughtful criticism and not just generation of novel ideas. The definitions for qualities such as ÒtechnicalÓ and ÒaestheticÓ pertaining to users, are too narrow and ill-defined. The author provides (examples/ stimulus/ experiences/ systems) of the project, its features and structures, studentsÕ notes and judgments, and their sketches and photographs of finished light bulb packages, in the Appendix.

41. ItÕs that time again: exams looming, essays or reports outstanding and you wonder where the yearÕs gone already. You start (deciding/ wondering/ hoping/ discovering) how you going to cope with it all. Fear and anxiety are insidious things and they can take hold if you donÕt do something about them. This amounts to a bad type of stress which is just what you donÕt need, especially at this time of year. This is not to say that all anxiety is bad, however. A limited amount of anxiety can help you to be more motivated and more (intelligent/ excitable/ relaxed/ purposeful). It can help you to plan your work and to think more clearly and (logically/ continually/ thoroughly/ consistently) about it. In other word, it can help you to stay on top of things. So how can you limit your stress and stay in control? There are a number of practical things you can do, even at this late stage before the exams. DonÕt give up hope, even if you start to feel ÒsnowballedÓ when you think of the all the work you have to do. First of all, it's essential to get yourself organised. Sit down at your desk and make a start on writing down all the things you have to do to (provide/arrange/prepare/order) for the exams. If you feel there's too much to do, then work out priorities for your work. Outstanding assignments should take priority but make sure to leave time for revision of your lecture notes.

42. Called Chomolungma ("goddess mother of the world") in Tibet and Sagarmatha ("goddess of the sky") in Nepal, Mount Everest once went by the pedestrian name of Peak XV among Westerners. That was before (scientists/ historians/ surveyors/ locals) established that it was the highest mountain on Earth, a fact that came as something of a surpriseÑPeak XV had seemed lost in the crowd of other formidable Himalayan peaks, many of which gave the (deception/ delusion/ feeling/ illusion) of greater height.
In 1852 the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India measured Everest's elevation as 29,002 feet above sea level. This figure remained the officially (considered/accepted/perceived/believed) height for more than one hundred years. In 1955 it was adjusted by a mere 26 feet to 29,028 (8,848 m).
The mountain received its official name in 1865 in honor of Sir George Everest, the British Surveyor General from 1830Ñ1843 who had mapped the Indian subcontinent. He had some (rejections/ reservations/ appeals/ reviews) about having his name bestowed on the peak, arguing that the mountain should retain its local appellation, the standard policy of geographical societies.
Before the Survey of India, a number of other mountains ranked supreme in the eyes of the world. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Andean peak Chimborazo was considered the highest.  At a relatively unremarkable 20,561 feet (6,310 m), it is in fact nowhere near the highest, (surpassed/ higher/ over/ transposed) by about thirty other Andean peaks and several dozen in the Himalayas. In 1809, the Himalayan peak Dhaulagiri (26,810 ft.; 8,172 m) was declared the ultimate, only to be shunted aside in 1840 by Kanchenjunga (28,208 ft.; 8,598 m), which today ranks third. Everest's status has been unrivalled for the last century-and-a-half, but not without a few threats.

43. If after years of Spanish classes, some people still find it impossible to understand some native speakers, they should not worry. This does not (necessarily/ usually/ only/ particularly) mean the lessons were wasted. Millions of Spanish speakers use neither standard Latin American Spanish nor Castilian, which predominate in U.S. schools.
The confusion is partly politicalÑthe Spanish-speaking world is very diverse. Spanish is the language of 19 separate countries and Puerto Rico. This means that there is no one standard dialect.
The most common Spanish dialect taught in the U.S. is standard Latin American. It is sometimes called "Highland" Spanish since it is generally spoken in the (mountainous/ rocky/ hidden/ coastal) areas of Latin America.
While each country retains its own (accents/ thoughts/ infections/ authority) and has some unique vocabulary, residents of countries such as Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia generally speak Latin American Spanish, especially in urban centers. This dialect is noted for its (pronunciation/ collection/ remembering/ elucidation) of each letter and its strong "r" sounds. This Spanish was spoken in Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and was brought to the Americas by the early colonists.
However, the Spanish of Madrid and of northern Spain, called Castilian, developed (characteristics/ moralities /problems/distinguishes) that never reached the New World. These include the pronunciation of ÒciÓ and ÒceÓ as Òth.Ó In Madrid, ÒgraciasÓ (thank you) becomes ÒgratheasÓ (as opposed to Ògras-see-asÓ in Latin America.) Another difference is the use of the word ÒvosotrosÓ (you all, or you guys) as the informal form of ÒustedesÓ in Spain. Castilian sounds to Latin Americans much like British English sounds to U.S. residents

44. The Eiffel Tower was the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1889. It was built for the World's Fair to (demonstrate / implicate/ suggest/ insinuate) that iron could be as strong as stone while being infinitely lighter.
And in fact the wrought-iron tower is twice as tall as the masonry Washington Monument and yet it weighs 70,000 tons less! It is repainted every seven years with 50 tons of dark brown paint.
Called Òthe father of the skyscraper,Ó the Home Insurance Building, (constructed/ renovated/ devised/ invented) in Chicago in 1885 (and demolished in 1931), was 138 feet tall and 10 stories. It was the first building to effectively employ a supporting (engine/ceiling/concrete/ skeleton) of steel beams and columns, allowing it to have many more windows than traditional masonry structures. But this new construction method made people worry that the building would fall down, leading the city to halt construction until they could (exonerate/ ameliorate/ investigate/ consecrate) the structure's safety.
In 1929, auto tycoon Walter Chrysler took part in an intense race with the Bank of Manhattan Trust Company to build the world's tallest skyscraper. Just when it looked like the bank had captured the (coveted/ meaningless/ royal/ informal) title, workers at the Chrysler Building jacked a thin spire hidden inside the building through the top of the roof to win the contest (subsequently losing the title four months later to the Empire State Building). Chrysler also decorated his building to mirror his cars, with hubcaps, mudguards, and hood ornaments.

45. Founded after World War II by 51 Òpeace-loving statesÓ combined to oppose future aggression, the UN now counts 193 member nations, (including/  especially/ possibly/ limiting) its newest members, Nauru, Kiribati, and Tonga in 1999, Tuvalu and Yugoslavia in 2000, Switzerland and East Timor in 2002, Montenegro in 2006, and South Sudan in 2011.
United Nations Day has been (watched/ observed/ monitored/ examined) on October 24 since 1948 and celebrates the objectives and accomplishments of the organization, which was established on October 24, 1945.
The UN (connects/ engages/ absorbs/ appoints) in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions across the globe. Though some say its (influence/ meaningless/ consequences/ descriptiveness) has declined in recent decades, the United Nations still plays a tremendous role in world politics. In 2001 the United Nations and Kofi Annan, then secretary-general of the UN, won the Nobel Peace Prize Òfor their work for a better organized and more peaceful world.Ó
Since 1948 there have been 63 UN peacekeeping (transgressions/ processes/ businesses/ operations); 16 are currently under way. Thus far, close to 130 nations have contributed personnel at various times; 119 are currently providing peacekeepers. As of 31 August 2008, there were 16 peacekeeping operations underway with a total of 88,230 personnel. The small island nation of Fiji has taken part in virtually every UN peacekeeping operation, as has Canada.

46. C. S. Lewis, or Jack Lewis, as he preferred to be called, was born in Belfast, Ireland (now Northern Ireland) on November 29, 1898. He was the second son of Albert Lewis, a lawyer, and Flora Hamilton Lewis. His older brother, Warren Hamilton Lewis, who was known as Warnie, had been born three years (ago/ previously/ earlier/ subsequently) in 1895.
Lewis's early childhood was relatively happy and carefree. In those days Northern Ireland was not yet (bothered/ plagued/ pestered/ doubted) by bitter civil strife, and the Lewises were comfortably off. The family home, called Little Lea, was a large, gabled house with dark, narrow passages and an overgrown garden, which Warnie and Jack played in and (explored/ watched/ inspired/ investigated) together. There was also a library that was crammed with booksÑ two of Jack's favorites were Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson and The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett.
This somewhat idyllic boyhood came to an end for Lewis when his mother became ill and died of cancer in 1908. Barely a month after her death the two boys were sent away from home to go to boarding school in England.
Lewis hated the school, with its strict rules and hard, (careless/ desensitized/ deliberative/ unsympathetic) headmaster, and he missed Belfast terribly. Fortunately for him, the school closed in 1910, and he was able to return to Ireland.
After a year, however, he was sent back to England to study. This time, the (experience/ essence/ understanding/ suffering) proved to be mostly positive. As a teenager, Lewis learned to love poetry, especially the works of Virgil and Homer. He also developed an interest in modern languages, mastering French, German, and Italian.

47. Federal Education Minister Julie Bishop says she has seen no evidence that foreign students are graduating from Australian universities with poor English skills.
Research by Monash University academic Bob Birrell has found a third of foreign students are graduating without a competent level of English. But Ms. Bishop says Australian universities only enrol foreign students once they have achieved international standards of language (expertise/ proficiency/ mastery/ advancement). ÒThis has been an extraordinary attack by Professor Birrell on our universities,Ó she said. ÒInternational students must meet international (benchmarks/ measures/ criterion/ standard) in English language in order to get a place at a university in Australia and they can't get into university without reaching that international standard.Ó
University of Canberra vice chancellor Roger Dean also says international students are required to sit an English test before being (enrolled/ registered/ admitted/ entered) to nearly all Australian universities. ÒThere are, of course, intercultural difficulties as well as language difficulties,Ó he said. ÒThere are, of course, also many Australian students who don't speak such fantastically good English either. So we're trying to push the standard even higher than present but it's a very useful one already.Ó
Ms Bishop says Australia's university system has high standards. ÒI've seen no evidence to suggest that students are not able to complete their courses because they're failing in English yet they're being passed by the universities,Ó she said. ÒI've not seen any evidence to back that up. International education is one of our largest exports, it's our fourth largest export and it's in the (benefit/ interest/ concern/ significance) of our universities to maintain very high standards because their reputation is at (stake/ ease/ best/ first).Ó

48. Mintel Consumer Intelligence (suggests/ estimates/ controls/ dominates) the 2002 market for vegetarian foods, those that directly replace meat or other animal products, to be $1.5 billion. Note that this excludes traditional vegetarian foods such as produce, pasta, and rice. Mintel forecasts the market to nearly double by 2006 to $2.8 billion, with the highest growth coming from soymilk, especially refrigerated brands.
The Food and Drug Administration's 1999 decision to allow manufacturers to include heart-healthy claims on foods that deliver at least 6.25 grams of soy protein per serving and are also low in saturated fat and cholesterol has spurred (exceptional/ tremendous/ extraordinary/ unique) interest in soymilk and other soy foods. A representative of manufacturer Food Tech International (Veggie Patch brand) reported that from 1998 to 1999, the percentage of consumers willing to try soy products jumped from 32% to 67%. Beliefs about soy's (effectiveness/ proficiency/ inclination/ tendency) in reducing the symptoms of menopause also attracted new consumers. A 2000 survey conducted by the United Soybean Board showed that the number of people eating soy products once a week or more was up to 27%. Forty-five percent of respondents had tried tofu, 41% had sampled veggie burgers, and 25% had experience with soymilk (Soyfoods USA e-mail newsletter). Mintel estimates 2001 sales of frozen and refrigerated meat (options/ choices/ preferences/ alternatives) in food stores at nearly $300 million, with soymilk sales nearing $250 million.

49. By the Bronze Age drinking vessels were being made of sheet metal, primarily bronze or gold. However, the peak of feasting - and in particular, of the 'political' type of feast - came in the late Hallstatt period (about 600-450 BC), soon after the foundation of the Greek (colony/ territory/ army/ dynasty) of Massalia (Marseille) at the mouth of the Rhine. From that date on, the blood of the grape began to make its way north and east along major river systems together with imported metal and ceramic drinking vessels from the Greek world.
(Wine/Juice/Water/Sparkling) was thus added to the list of mood-altering beverages - such as mead and ale - available to establish social networks in Iron Age Europe. Attic pottery fragments found at hillforts such as Heuneburg in Germany and luxury goods such as the monumental 5th century Greek bronze krater (or wine mixing vessel) found at Vix in Burgundy supply archaeological evidence of this interaction. Organic (boxes/ containers/ bucket/ carton) such as leather or wooden wine barrels may also have travelled north into Europe but have not survived. It is unknown what goods were (sold/ purchased/ exchanged/ traded) in return, but they may have included salted meat, hides, timber, amber and slaves.

50. ÔJust-in-time' is a management philosophy and not a technique. It originally referred to the production of goods to meet customer (supply/ demand/ need/ want) exactly, in time, quality and quantity, (or /whether/ when/ if/ where) the `customer' is the final purchaser of the product or another process (longer/ further/ faster/ quicker) along the production line. It has now come to mean producing with (low/ high/ maximum/ minimum) waste. "Waste" is taken in its most general sense and includes time and resources as well as materials.

51. For all his fame and celebration, William Shakespeare remains a (mysterious/ intelligent/ funny/ odd) figure with regards to personal history. There are just two primary (references/ sources/ data/ ideas) for information on the Bard: his works, and various legal and church documents that have survived from Elizabethan times. Naturally, there are many (distances/ gaps/ errors/ confirmations) in this body of information, which tells us little about Shakespeare the man.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, allegedly on April 23, 1564. Church records from Holy Trinity Church indicate that he was baptized there on April 26, 1564. Young William was born of John Shakespeare, a glover and leather merchant, and Mary Arden, a landed local heiress.
William, according to the church register, was the third of eight (members /children/ factors/ earners) in the Shakespeare householdÑthree of whom died in childhood. John Shakespeare had a remarkable run of success as a merchant, alderman, and high bailiff of Stratford, during William's early childhood. His fortunes declined, however, in the late 1570s.

52. Top US business schools are recruiting younger, less experienced candidates in an effort to boost applications and head off competition for the best students from other graduate programmes such as law and public policy.
In an attempt to (lure/ recruit/ seduce/ enchant) new students, leading business schools - including Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago and Wharton - have moved away from the unofficial admissions (necessity/ rule/ standard/ prerequisite) of four years' work experience and instead have set their (ways/ feet/ eyes/ sights) on recent college graduates and so-called Òearly careerÓ professionals with only a couple years of work under their (belt/ seat/ nose/ fire).

53. From the wolves' perspective, this is clearly good news. But it also had beneficial effects on the ecology of the park, according to a study published in 2004 by William Ripple and Robert Beschta from Oregon State University. In their paper in BioScience, the two researchers showed that reintroducing the wolves was (related/ correlated/ coincided/ referred) with increased growth of willow and cottonwood in the park. Why? Because (feeding/ grazing/ chewing/ nibbling) animals such as elk were avoiding sites from which they couldn't easily escape, the scientists (questioned/ doubted/ claimed/ thought). And as the woody plants and trees grew taller and thicker, beaver (groups/ settlement/ land/ colonies) expanded.
Of course, not every wolf story is positive. National Public Radio in the US reported last July that a nine-year-old programme to reintroduce the endangered Mexican grey wolf in the south-western US was struggling because some wolves weren't learning to hunt in the wild and because others were simply being shot. Perhaps the shotgun response of locals in the mountains of Arizona and New Mexico was unsurprising, for the wolves had been preying on (animals/ livestock/ mammals/ pets). The reintroduction area is apparently grazing land.

54. The most vital ingredient in Indian cooking, the basic element with which all (food/ cuisines/ plates/ dishes) begin and, normally, the cheapest vegetable available, the pink onion is an essential item in the shopping basket of families of all classes.
A popular saying holds that you will never starve because you can always afford a roti (a piece of simple, flat bread) and an onion.
But in recent weeks, the onion has started to seem an unaffordable (item/ sales/ goods/ luxury) for India's poor. Over the past few days, another sharp (plunge/ surge/ plummet/ growth) in prices has begun to unsettle the influential urban middle classes.
The sudden spike in prices has been caused by large exports to neighbouring countries and a shortage of (demand/ supply/ production/ crops). But the increase follows a trend of rising consumer prices across the board Ñ from diesel fuel to cement, from milk to lentils.

55. Surely, reality is what we think it is; reality is (revealed/ concealed/ discovered/ delivered) to us by our experiences.
To one extent or another, this view of reality is one many of us hold, if only (explicitly/ implicitly/ obviously/ overtly). I certainly find myself thinking this way in day-to-day life; itÕs easy to be (lusted/ admired/ desired/ seduced) by the face nature reveals directly to our senses. Yet, in the decades since first (meeting/ encountering/ seeing/ confronting) CamusÕ text, IÕve learned that modern science (speaks/ tells/ says/ means) a very different story. The overarching lesson that has emerged from scientific inquiry over the last century is that human experience is often a misleading guide to the true nature of reality.

56. The ocean floor is home to many unique communities of plants and animals. Most of these marine ecosystems are near the water surface, such as the Great Barrier Reef, a 2,000-km-long coral (formation/ constitution/ disposition/ consolation) off the north-eastern coast of Australia. Coral reefs, like nearly all complex living communities, depend on solar energy for growth. The sun's energy, however, penetrates at most only about 300 m below the surface of the water. The relatively shallow penetration of solar energy and the sinking of cold, sub-polar water combine to make most of the deep ocean floor a (frigid/ perfect/ temperate/ frozen) environment with few life forms.
In 1977, scientists discovered hot springs at a depth of 2.5 km, on the Galapagos Rift (spreading ridge) off the coast of Ecuador. This exciting discovery was not really (a potent/ a fate/ an expectation/ a surprise). Since the early 1970s, scientists had predicted that hot springs (geothermal vents) should be found at the active spreading centers along the mid-oceanic ridges, where magma, at temperatures over 1,000 ¡C, presumably was being erupted to form new oceanic crust. More exciting, because it was totally unexpected, was the discovery of abundant and unusual sea life -- giant tube worms, huge clams, and mussels -- that (languished/ lured/ thrived/ filed) around the hot springs.

57. In the fast-changing world of modern healthcare, the job of a doctor is more and more like the job of chief executive. The people who run hospitals and physicians' practices don't just need to know medicine. They must also be able to (handle/ divide/ balance/ boost) budgets, (enlarge/ downsize/ motivate/ encourage) a large and diverse staff and make difficult marketing and legal decisions.
ÒThe focus in medical school is to train good doctors, but part of being a good doctor is being a good manager,Ó says Fawaz Siddiqi, a neurosurgical resident at the London Health Sciences Centre in Canada. ÒIt's having a core understanding of how to work within the (background/ context/ situation/ circumstance) of an organisation.Ó
The desire to be a Ògood managerÓ is precisely the reason Dr Siddiqi, who (aspires/ inspires/ craves/ respires) one day to run a hospital, decided to go back to school. This past autumn he enrolled in a health-sector MBA programme at the Ivey School of Business at the University of Western Ontario

58. Richard Morris, of the school of accounting at the University of NSW, which requires an entrance (grade/ mark/ grading/ score) in the top 5 per cent of students, says attendance has been a problem since the late 1990s.
ÒSometimes in the lectures we've only got about one- third of students enrolled attending,Ó he said.
ÒIt definitely is a problem. If you don't turn up to class you're missing out on the whole (resourcefulness/ thoroughness/ completeness/ richness) of the experience: you don't think a whole lot, you don't engage in debates with other students - or with your teachers.Ó
It is not all gloom, said Professor John Dearn, a Pro Vice-Chancellor at the University of Canberra, who said the internet was transforming the way students access and use information.
ÒIt is strange that (due to/ according to/ despite/ regarding) all the evidence as to their ineffectiveness, traditional lectures seem to (continue/ persevere/ maintain/ persist) in our universities.Ó

59. Researchers already know that spending long periods of time in a zero-gravity environment Ñ such as that inside the International Space Station (ISS) Ñ results in loss of bone density and (danger/ illnesses/ damage/ harm) to the body's muscles. That's partly why stays aboard the ISS are (exceeded/surpassed/covered/capped) at six months. And now, a number of NASA astronauts are reporting that their (vision/ perception/ views/ perspective) faded after spending time in space, with many needing glasses once they returned to Earth.

60. The inevitable consequences include rampant corruption, an absence of globally competitive Chinese companies, and (chronic / continuous / sustained / enduring) waste of resources, rampant environmental (debug/ degradation/ degeneration/derogation) and soaring inequality.
Above all, the monopoly over power of an ideologically bankrupt communist party is (parallel/ inconsistent/ true/ logical) with the pluralism of opinion, security of property and vibrant competition on which a dynamic economy depends. As a result, Chinese development remains parasitic on know-how and institutions developed elsewhere.

61. Arab students will be able to sign up to study at a (range/ scope/ reach/ distance) for the business courses in their own language. The Edinburgh Business School (informed/ announced/ disclosed/ published) the project at a reception in Cairo on Saturday. It is hoped the course will improve links between the university and the Arab business world. A university spokeswoman said: ÒThe Arabic MBA will raise the (character/ characteristics/ review/ profile) of Heriot-Watt University and the Edinburgh Business School among businesses in the Arabic-speaking world and will create a strong network of graduates in the region.Ó The first (admission/ intake/ entrance/ introduction) of students is expected later this year.
Professor Keith Lumsden, director of Edinburgh Business School, said: ÒArabic is a major global language and the Arab world is a centre for business and industrial development. We are proud to work with Arab International Education to meet the demands of the region.

62. According to the literature, the history of vaccination can be traced back to as early as the 7th century when the monks in India tried to (immunize/ inject/ disinfect/ sterilize) themselves by drinking snake venom. The first vaccination was inoculation with human smallpox, a practice widely carried out in ancient India, Arabia, and China. This method of vaccination consisted of collecting pus from a patient suffering from (delicate/ mild/ low/ weak) form of smallpox virus infection and inoculating the sample to a healthy human, which later led to a minor infection.
This method was first introduced in England by a Greek named E. Timoni. However, this method had a risk of spreading smallpox in the community and even worsening the health condition of the person who received the inoculation.
While the use of human smallpox vaccine was controversial, E. Jenner came up with bovine smallpox vaccine in 1796; this new method also faced controversy, but continued to be (theorised/ universalized/ hospitalised/ critised). Smallpox became a preventable disease by injecting pus extracted from a human infected with cowpox virus.
Jenner (called/ titled/ named/ entitled) the substance ÒvaccineÓ after the Latin word ÒvaccaÓ which means Òcow,Ó and thus the process of giving vaccine became ÒvaccinationÓ.

63. Gas drilling on the Indonesian island of Java has (triggered/ produced/ provoked/ sparked) a Òmud volcanoÓ that has killed 13 people and may render four square miles (ten square kilometres) of countryside uninhabitable for years.
In a report released on January 23, a team of British researchers says the deadly upwelling began when an exploratory gas well punched through a layer of rock 9,300 feet (2,800 meters) below the surface, allowing hot, high-pressure water to (run/ flow/ leak/ escape).
The water carried mud to the surface, where it has spread across a region 2.5 miles (4 kilometres) in (length/ width/ magnitude/ diameter) in the eight months since the eruption began.
The mud volcano is similar to a gusher or blowout, which occur in oil drilling when oil or gas squirt to the surface, the team says. This upwelling, however, spews out a volume of mud equivalent to a dozen Olympic swimming pools each day.
Although the eruption isn't as violent as a (traditional/ popular/ ordinary/ conventional) volcano, more than a dozen people died when a natural gas pipeline ruptured.
The research team, who published their findings in the February issue of GSA Today, also estimate that the volcano, called Lusi, will leave more than 11,000 people permanently (replaced/ displaced/ expelled/ evicted).

64. Stress is what you feel when you have to handle more than you are used to. When you are stressed, your body (responses/ responds/ counter/ reciprocate) as though you are in danger. It makes (tissues/ tendons/ hormones/ fluid) that speed up your heart, make you breathe faster, and give you a (burst/ boost/ flare/ outbreak) of energy. This is called the fight-or-flight stress response.
Some stress is normal and even useful. Stress can help if you need to work hard or react quickly. For example, it can help you win a race or finish an important job on time.
But if stress happens too often or lasts too long, it can have bad effects. It can be linked to headaches, a/an (upset/ stagnant/ distressed/ cramped) stomach, back pain, and trouble sleeping. It can weaken your immune system, making it harder to fight (in/on/out/off) disease. If you already have a health problem, stress may make it worse. It can make you moody, tense, or depressed. Your relationships may suffer, and you may not do well at work or school.

65. In our studies, those people on a higher-protein diet lost the same amount of weight as those on a higher-carbohydrate diet. This is because the two diets (tendered/ offered/ presented/ admitted) an equal amount of fat. However, body composition (that is, the ratio of fat to muscle) showed greater improvement among those people on the higher-protein diet. When the (participants/ contributors/ observers/ members) in other studies were allowed to eat until they were no longer hungry, those on the higher-protein diet lost more weight than those on the higher-carbohydrate diet, even after more than a year. The reduction in hunger and the beneficial effect on muscle provided by the higher-protein diet is mostly related to its protein content, while the enhanced fat-loss seems to be related to its lower amounts of carbohydrate. The diet is healthy because its protein comes from lean red meat fish, chicken and low-fat dairy products, all of which (allow/ supplement/ encourage/ provide) good nutrition. A high-protein diet in which the protein comes from protein powders and supplements is unlikely to be healthy, unless the supplements are (supplied/ equipped/ prepared/ fortified) with vitamins and minerals.

66. Pinker has argued that swathes of our mental, social and emotional lives may have (described/ resulted/ originated/ regarded) as evolutionary adaptations. Sometimes it seems as if nothing is (immune/ prevented/ derived/ different) from being explained this way. Road rage, adultery, marriage, altruism small number of women who become mechanical engineers Ð all may have their (results/ roots/ beliefs/ definitions) in natural selection, Pinker claims. The controversial implications are obvious that men and women might (compare/ believe/ result/ differ) in their inborn abilities at performing certain tasks, for example, or that parenting may have (little/ small/ some/ more) influence on personality.
