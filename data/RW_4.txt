4. The environmental impact of the global textile industry is hard to overstate. One-third of the water used worldwide is spent fashioning fabrics. For every ton of cloth                  (produced/ made/ generated/ provided), 200 tons of water is polluted with chemicals and heavy metals. An estimated 1 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity powers the factories that card and comb, spin and weave, and cut and stitch materials into everything from T-shirts to towels, (abandoning/ leaving/ dumping/ throwing) behind mountains of solid waste and a massive carbon footprint.
“Where the industry is today is not really sustainable for the long term,” says Shreyaskar Chaudhary, chief executive of Pratibha Syntex, a textile manufacturer based in India. With something of an “if you build it, they will come” attitude, Mr Chaudhary has steered Pratibha (for/ to/ at/ toward) the leading edge of eco-friendly textile production.
Under his direction, Pratibha began making clothes with organic cotton in 1999. Initially, the company couldn't find enough organic farms growing cotton in central India to (supply/ indulge/ help/ develop) its factories. To meet production demands, Chaudhary's team had to convince conventional cotton farmers to change their growing methods. Pratibha provided seeds, cultivation instruction, and a guarantee of fair-trade prices for (farmers’/ their/ its/ peasants’) crops.
