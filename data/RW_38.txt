38. Film is where art meets commerce. (So/As/For/What) Orson Welles said: “A painter just needs a brush and the writer just needs a pen, but the producer needs an army.” And an army needs money. A producer is just like an entrepreneur, we (raise /arise/ rise/ arouse) money to make films. First we need to find an original idea or a book or a play and purchase the rights, then we need money to develop that idea often a reasonably small sum. (Besides/However/Certainly/Therefore), to commission a writer for the screenplay isn’t something you would want to gamble your own money on, so you find a partner. We are luck here in the UK, as we have Film4, BBC Films and the UK Film Council, all of those are good places to develop an idea. Producing in Britain is very different to producing in America or (even/ still/ despite/ also) Europe because the economic dynamic is different.
