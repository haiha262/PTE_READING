65. In our studies, those people on a higher-protein diet lost the same amount of weight as those on a higher-carbohydrate diet. This is because the two diets (tendered/ offered/ presented/ admitted) an equal amount of fat. However, body composition (that is, the ratio of fat to muscle) showed greater improvement among those people on the higher-protein diet. When the (participants/ contributors/ observers/ members) in other studies were allowed to eat until they were no longer hungry, those on the higher-protein diet lost more weight than those on the higher-carbohydrate diet, even after more than a year. The reduction in hunger and the beneficial effect on muscle provided by the higher-protein diet is mostly related to its protein content, while the enhanced fat-loss seems to be related to its lower amounts of carbohydrate. The diet is healthy because its protein comes from lean red meat fish, chicken and low-fat dairy products, all of which (allow/ supplement/ encourage/ provide) good nutrition. A high-protein diet in which the protein comes from protein powders and supplements is unlikely to be healthy, unless the supplements are (supplied/ equipped/ prepared/ fortified) with vitamins and minerals.
