29. Students are increasingly finding it necessary to obtain employment in order to subsidize their income during their time in higher education. The (plus/ other/ more/ super/ extra) income helps to pay for necessities, to maintain a social life and to buy clothes, and holding a part-time job helps students to (gain/ need/ reach/ make/ train) skills for life after university or college. Using a part-time job to cut down on borrowing is a sound investment, as it reduces the (debt/ bank/ surplus/ account/ money) that will be waiting to be paid off after graduation. How many hours students are currently working each week during term-time is not really certain. Some institutions advise that students should not work more than ten hours a week, and there are others that set a higher recommend (boundary/ edge/ law/ limit/ border) of fifteen hours a week. There is no doubt that some students (exceed/ improve/ overdo/ raise/ increase) even fifteen hours a week.

Answer : extra/ gain  / suitability / debt / limit /exceed
