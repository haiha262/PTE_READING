13. There were twenty-six freshmen (majoring/ studying/ enrolling/ joining) in English at Beijing Language Institute in the class of 1983, I was assigned to Group Two with another eleven boys and girls who had (come/ arrived/ originally / born) from big cities in China. I was only the student who had been raised in a small village. On the first day of class, I arrived eager (to begin/beginning/begin/began) I settled myself at a desk and only then did I (realise/to realise/ realising/ realized) I was told that language study required smallness so that we would get more attention from the skilful teachers. The better the school, the smaller the class. I realized that my classmates were already all (talking/ speaking/ telling/ communicating) in English, simple sentences tossed out to each other in their red-faced introductions and carefree chatting. Their intonations were curving and dramatic and their pronunciation refined and accurate. But as I stretched to catch the drips and drops of their humming dialogue, I couldn't (understand/ understood/ to understand/ understanding) it all, only that it was English. Those words now flying before me sounded a little familiar. I had read them and tried to speak them, but I had never heard them (spoken/to speak/speak/speaking) back to me in such a speedy, fluent manner. My big plan of (beating/ smashing/trashing/destroying) the city folks was thawing before my eyes.
