51. For all his fame and celebration, William Shakespeare remains a (mysterious/ intelligent/ funny/ odd) figure with regards to personal history. There are just two primary (references/ sources/ data/ ideas) for information on the Bard: his works, and various legal and church documents that have survived from Elizabethan times. Naturally, there are many (distances/ gaps/ errors/ confirmations) in this body of information, which tells us little about Shakespeare the man.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, allegedly on April 23, 1564. Church records from Holy Trinity Church indicate that he was baptized there on April 26, 1564. Young William was born of John Shakespeare, a glover and leather merchant, and Mary Arden, a landed local heiress.
William, according to the church register, was the third of eight (members /children/ factors/ earners) in the Shakespeare householdâ€”three of whom died in childhood. John Shakespeare had a remarkable run of success as a merchant, alderman, and high bailiff of Stratford, during William's early childhood. His fortunes declined, however, in the late 1570s.
