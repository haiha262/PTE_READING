14. One thing is certain. Most people do not get enough exercise in their          (daily/frequent/recurrent/periodic) routines. All of the advances of modern technology â€“ from (electric/ electrician/ electrically/ electricity) can openers to power steering - have made life easier, more comfortable and much less physically (severe/ demanding/ relaxing/ insistent). Yet our bodies need activity, especially if they are carrying around too (many/ little/ less/ much) fat. Satisfying this need requires a definite plan, and a commitment. There are two (odd/ main/ large/ substantial) ways to increase the number of calories you expand:
Start a regular exercise program if you do not have one already.
Increase the amount of physical activity in your daily routine.



Answer : daily / electric / demanding / much / main
