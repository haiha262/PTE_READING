32. Look at the recent “Most Respected Companies” survey by the Financial Times. Who are the most respected companies and business leaders at the (current/same/right/exact) time? Rather predictably, they are Jack Weich and General Electric, and Bill Gates, and Microsoft (both/neither/all/two) have achieved their world class status through playing nice. Wetch is still remembered for the brutal downsizing he led his business (out/from/through/to) and for the environmental pollution incidents and prosecutions. Microsoft has had one of the (highest/most/finest/best) profile cases of bullying market dominance of recent times – and Gates has been able to (improve/receive/increase/achieve) the financial status where he can choose to give lots of money away by being ruthless in business. 


Answer : current / both / through / highest / achieve
