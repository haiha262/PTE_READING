10. Agrarian parties are political parties chiefly representing the interests of peasants or, more broadly, the rural sector of society. The extent to which they are important, or (whether/ when/ as if/ if) they even exist, depends mainly on two factors. One, obviously, is the size of an identifiable peasantry, or the size of the rural relative (to/ in/ of/ from) the urban population. The other is a matter of social integration: (to/ for/ as/ of) agrarian parties to be important, the representation of countryside or peasantry must be not integrated with the other sections of society. (So/ However/ Thus/ Although) a country might possess a sizeable rural population, but have an economic system in which the interests of the voters depended predominantly on their incomes (higher/ rather/ better/ bigger/ other) than their occupations or location; and in such a country the political system would be unlikely to include an important agrarian party.
