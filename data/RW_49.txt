50. â€˜Just-in-time' is a management philosophy and not a technique. It originally referred to the production of goods to meet customer (supply/ demand/ need/ want) exactly, in time, quality and quantity, (or /whether/ when/ if/ where) the `customer' is the final purchaser of the product or another process (longer/ further/ faster/ quicker) along the production line. It has now come to mean producing with (low/ high/ maximum/ minimum) waste. "Waste" is taken in its most general sense and includes time and resources as well as materials.



Answer : demand  / whether / further / minimum
