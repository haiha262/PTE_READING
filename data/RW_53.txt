53. From the wolves' perspective, this is clearly good news. But it also had beneficial effects on the ecology of the park, according to a study published in 2004 by William Ripple and Robert Beschta from Oregon State University. In their paper in BioScience, the two researchers showed that reintroducing the wolves was (related/ correlated/ coincided/ referred) with increased growth of willow and cottonwood in the park. Why? Because (feeding/ grazing/ chewing/ nibbling) animals such as elk were avoiding sites from which they couldn't easily escape, the scientists (questioned/ doubted/ claimed/ thought). And as the woody plants and trees grew taller and thicker, beaver (groups/ settlement/ land/ colonies) expanded.
Of course, not every wolf story is positive. National Public Radio in the US reported last July that a nine-year-old programme to reintroduce the endangered Mexican grey wolf in the south-western US was struggling because some wolves weren't learning to hunt in the wild and because others were simply being shot. Perhaps the shotgun response of locals in the mountains of Arizona and New Mexico was unsurprising, for the wolves had been preying on (animals/ livestock/ mammals/ pets). The reintroduction area is apparently grazing land.
