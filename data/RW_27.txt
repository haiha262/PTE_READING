Inevitably, there are unintentional modifications as well, partly because of straightforward error, and partly because inexplicit ideas are hard to (convey/ contact/ control/ conclude) accurately: there is no way to download them directly from one brain to another like computer programs. Even native speakers of a language will not give identical definitions of every word. So it can be only rarely, if (ever/ often/ true/ only), that two people hold precisely the same cultural idea in their minds.
