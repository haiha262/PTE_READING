1. Traditionally, poverty has been measured by the lack of a minimum income or consumption level necessary to meet basic needs. Measuring poverty on a global scale (requires/ needs/ keeps/ improves) establishing a uniform poverty level across extremely divergent economies, which can result in only rough comparisons. The World Bank has defined the international poverty line as U.S. $1 and $2 per day in 1993 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), which adjusts for differences in the (prices/ costs/ charges / fees) of goods and services between countries. The $1 per day level is generally used for the (least/ secondary/ less/ profit) developed countries, primarily African; the $2-per-day level is used for middle (income/ revenue/ profit/ cost) economies such as those of East Asia and Latin America.

Answer : requires / prices / least / income
