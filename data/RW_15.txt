15. Scientists preparing for NASA’s proposed Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter believe that Jupiter’s moons Europa may be a corrosive mixture of acid and peroxide. Thus, it may not be the (ideal/ suitable/ relevant/ correct/ lucky) place for life to exist as was thought possibly to be the case. (Virtually/ Completely/ Eventually/ Entirely/ Scarcely)  all the information we have about Europa comes from the spacecraft Galileo, which completed its mission to study Jupiter and its moons close up before NASA dramatically crashed it into Jupiter in 2003. (Because/ Although/ Despite/ Whatever/ Whether) the general perception of Europa is of a frozen crust of water ice harbouring a salty subterranean ocean kilometres below, researchers studying the most             (recent/ unusual/ last/ interesting) measurements say light reflected from the moon’s icy surface bears the spectral fingerprints of hydrogen peroxide and strong acids. (Instead/ Just/ Regardless/ However/ Therefore) they accept that it could just be a thin surface dusting and might not come from the ocean below.




Answer : ideal / Virtually / Although / recent / However
