33. Everybody needs fresh water. (Beside/Outside/Without/Under) water people, animals & plants cannot live. Although a few plants and animals can make do with saltwater, all humans need a constant supply of fresh water to stay (fit/good/well/happy)Â & healthy. Of the total supply of water on the Earth, only about 3% of it is fresh, & most of that is stored as ice & snow at the poles, or is so (deep/much/long/dirty) under the surface of the Earth that we cannot get to it. Despite so much of the water being out of reach, we still have a million cubic miles of it that we (might/may/will/ can) use. That's about 4,300,000 cubic kilometers of fresh water to share out between most of the plants, animals & people on the planet!
